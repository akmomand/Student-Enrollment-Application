This is a fully functioning student information application with the following features:

1- A login screen: The first screen/view is a login/authentication screen. A user  
can't access any other screen within the app unless the user is 
authenticated. So, all unauthenticated users should be redirected to the login page. 

2- Dashboard â€“ Home/Main screen: The main screen/view after login is a 
dashboard. The dashboard contains information about the number of enrolled 
students, average GPA, number of seniors, juniors and freshmen, number of courses 
offered etc. It includes two graphs; a bar chart, which represents student enrollment 
across different academic years (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) and a pie chart 
which shows the distribution of student majors (Physics, IT, Chemistry, Marketing, Stats). 

3- Student details: This screen is an info screen that displays student information (first 
name, last name, major, year and GPA). I use a table to display this info. 

4- Course details: This info screen shows all the courses available. I use a 
table to display this information. 

5- Student Enrollment: This screen shows all the courses a particular student is enrolled in 
and I use a drop down to switch between different students). Additionally, this screen allows the 
user to enroll students into courses.
